I'm Hongsup/홍섭 and I am an ML practitioner in Austin, TX. I currently work as a Principal ML Research Engineer at Arm, and volunteer as a co-chair of the SciPy conference Proceedings Committee. In the past, I volunteered at [Texas Justice Initiative](https://texasjusticeinitiative.org/), a local criminal justice non-profit in Austin, and other organizations such as DataKind, NeurIPS, and SciPy as grant and paper reviewers. I run an in-person [ML journal club](https://austinmljournalclub.github.io/) in Austin, TX.

My background is computational neuroscience (PhD) and behavioral ecology (MSc). My general interests are ML Ops, AI ethics, responsible AI, and ML in hardware. Feel free to reach out to me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hongsupshin/) and check out some of my work:

I participate in volunteering whenever I can. Until recently, I was a volunteer data scientist at [Texas Justice Initiative](https://texasjusticeinitiative.org/), a criminal justice non-profit in Austin, TX. I also volunteered as a reviwer for [SciPy](https://conference.scipy.org/), [DataKind](https://www.datakind.org/), and [NeurIPS](https://neurips.cc/). In 2024, I am volunteering as a co-chair of the [Scipy](https://www.scipy2024.scipy.org/) [Proceedings](https://github.com/scipy-conference/scipy_proceedings) Committee.

I love sharing ideas with others and I am interested in building communities. I've oragnized [Austin ML Journal Club](https://austinmljournalclub.github.io/) where local ML practitioners read ML papers every month and discuss in person. I also participated in local meetups such as [Women in Data Science-ATX](https://www.meetup.com/Women-in-Data-Science-ATX/) and [Austin Python Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/austinpython/).
